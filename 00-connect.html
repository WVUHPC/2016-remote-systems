<p>There are almost an infinite number of ways to interact with remote computers. Everytime you recieve mail or visit a webpage, you interface with a remote server. Depending on what service or information you are trying to achieve, you will use different tools. When utilizing a remote system to do scientific computing, we want a login shell on the remote system. Login shells are identical to the Unix shells you have used in the past, the only difference is when you type a command, that command is passed through a network connection to the other system, executed on that system, and the output is then passed to your local screen. This type of connection is called a remote login, as opposed to a local login (i.e. when you login or boot up your personal computer). The most common way to initiate a remote login is by using the <code>ssh</code> command, which utilizes the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.</p>
<p>Before you connect to a remote system, you need to know two pieces of information: 1) the hostname of the remote system. 2) your username/password on the remote system. The hostname is similar to a URL (www.google.com), in that it gives the network address of the remote system in human readable format. The hostname of the system is usually on the internal documentation of the system, or may even be on a Wiki/webpage setup for end users of the system. Or you might have gotten this information from the System adminstrators when they set-up your account. Your username/password will be associated with the account setup for you. <strong>You must have an account on the system in order for the <code>ssh</code> command to grant you access to the remote system</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you have the two pieces of information, you can initiate a login request using the ssh command.</p>

<div class="panel-body">
<p>In our example, we use the hostname ‘spruce.hpc.wvu.edu’ (Spruce Knob) and the username ‘training01’. You might need to change these parts of the command to match your hostname/username you are trying to connect to.</p>

<p>When typing into a password prompt, characters will not display on the screen. This is to prevent anybody from seeing you type in your password.<br />

<p>The previous <code>ssh</code> command directed the username with the ‘-l’ option. There are other ways to indicate the username to be used. One way is to include the username in the hostname, separating the two with an ‘@’ symbol - just like an email address.</p>

<p>Once you are connected to a remote system, you will notice that you have a Unix shell that looks and works exactly the same as other Unix shells you have used in the past.</p>
