title: Working with Remote Systems
---

The Unix Shell is a great tool; but it is limited by the current resources 
contained on the physical machine it resides on.  One revolutionary invention 
was sharing many computers to broaden tools that are available to you.  A great 
example of this is the Internet. A computer that you don't have physical access 
to, may have services and tools of great importance to your work.  The only way 
to get access to these services is by connecting remotely.  These two lessons 
will teach you how to connect to remote systems and transfer files to and from 
remote systems - all from the command-line.

> ## Prerequisites {.prereq}
>
> This lesson assumes basic experience with the Unix shell.  If you have ever 
> ran programs on a Unix/Linux system and created, copied, moved 
> files/directories from within the Unix shell.  Then you are ready for this 
> lesson.
>
> If you have previously used ssh, scp, and sftp before, you probably won't 
> learn much from this lesson.
